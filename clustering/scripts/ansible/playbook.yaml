# This playbook first installs the distribution specified in <distro_name> on
# ODL nodes specified in <cluster_config>, and then configures the nodes to
# form a cluster. <install_script> is invoked on every ODL node to perform
# ODL installation and cluster configuration.
#
# The playbook assumes that there is passwordless ssh access from the node
# where the ansible playbook is executed to the ODL nodes. To achieve that,
# you need to copy the public keys from the asnible machine to the ODL nodes.
